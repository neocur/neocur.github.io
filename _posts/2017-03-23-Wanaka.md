Wanaka, take it easy.

This place is the very picture of composure. It took more than four hours to go from Franz Josef Glacier by car.

The Wanaka Tree is quite possibly the world's most famous tree. That's the tree that makes me come here through one of my favorite Michael Kenna photograph.

Early the next morning I was going there again. The unfamiliar moon hung in the sky. It must be a old crescent, to be sure, judging from the lunar calendar. But it looked like a waxing crescent moon so far as I know. 

New Zealand! I soon realized that this is the southern hemisphere. 
There were still so many stars in the sky although the day is just dawning. 

Walking along the shore of Lake Wanaka till dawn.
