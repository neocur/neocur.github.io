title: "JEJU ISLAND WINTER 2018: DAY TWO"
---

On the second day of my winter trip to Jeju island, I awoke to a heavy snowfall. I got an early start and headed to Bukchon, a village on the northeastern coast of Jeju island. I needed to put on snow chains.

I'm often fascinated as I stand at the end of pier and look at the sea.
