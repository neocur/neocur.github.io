title: "JEJU ISLAND WINTER 2018: DAY ONE"
---

It was a heavy snowfall this winter in Jeju island. Absolutely I love exploring Jeju island. One of my goal for this trip was to photograph subjects made of snow.

I started this trip to the inland area of western Jeju and set out search of a good subject.
