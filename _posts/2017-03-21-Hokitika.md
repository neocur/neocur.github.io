Hokitika

I just stopped over at this place from Arthur's Pass to Franz Josef. I'd like to have stayed long though.

It was heavily cloudy and sometimes drizzling, which made the landscape be toned down dramatically.
Haze blurred the horizon and much more made a long time exposure.

I just took a couple of photographs and walked along the shore.
