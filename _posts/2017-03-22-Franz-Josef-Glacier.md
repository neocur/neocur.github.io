Franz Josef Glacier

Unlike other glaciers, Franz Josef is just a short walk from a car park. To watch the glacier you have to walk through the valley a lot than you think. The magnificent scenery would certainly make a road shorter though.

Walking up and down along a path through the ferns you can reach Peters Pool, as well as the historic Douglas suspension bridge. From the pool, I spent a lot of time taking reflective views of the glacier and surrounding mountain peaks in this serene place.

I headed back to the glacier viewing platform. In the distance appeared an azure light already.
